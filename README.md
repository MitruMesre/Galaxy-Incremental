# Galaxy-Incremental
## How to play:
You start with 1 Solar Panel, which accumulates electricity for free.
You also start with 1 Mining Droid, and can freely assign it to mine Ice, Iron, or Silicon.

You spend Rocket Fuel based on how many Mining Droids you have active, and can create more by toggling on the Rocket Fuel Refinery.

You can also spend Iron and Silicon to create additional Solar Panels and Mining Droids.
